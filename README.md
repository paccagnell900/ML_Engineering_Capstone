Conversation AI team has developed several models to improve the monitoring of conversation online. The main issue of these models (despite the error in the prediction as such) is the fact that they don’t allow to label the type of toxicity of the comments analyzed. This means that we cannot really generalize the use of these predictions, as not all online platforms may be willing to act on a text (e.g., with censorship) with the same level of intervention. It will mainly depend on the internal policy of the company. Therefore, the possibility to develop a model that will grant the possibility to define and label the type/tone of a text data type into a specific category, e.g., “insult”, “threats”, etc., it is quite interesting. 

In order to do so, we will be using a set of NLP models, with increasing complexity, to identify the one that is better performing with the provided dataset and possibly scalable on other NLP text classification problems. The models we have identified for this project are: “Bag of Words, “Word2Vec Embeddings”, “FastText Embeddings”, “Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)” and possibly other two NLP models like “Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)” and “Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers (BERT)”. 
The benchmark model that will be used is the simpler model at the base of Text Classification, i.e. “Bag of Words”. In this model, a text is represented as a “bag” (multiset) of words, disregarding grammar and even word order but keeping multiplicity. We will be using a sklearn implementation of “Bag of Words”, CounterVectorizer, to convert the provided text into a numerical matrix that can be than mapped on the pre-defined set of label provided (i.e. “toxic”, “severe toxic”, “obscene”, “threat”, “insult” and “identity hate”). We will then use a Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression algorithms on data created by the CountVectorizer and will keep as benchmark the one which is better performing. The prediction will be then realizes by using a Multi-Output Classifier from sklearn to predict all 6 categories.
